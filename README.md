[Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is a popular workflow tool for scheduling and monitoring the ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) process in modern data engineering.
It allows users to create a data pipeline between various data sources such as RDBMS, API, spreadsheet, and data warehouse. 

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), Google's managed data warehouse, is one of the most frequently used data warehouses for its flexibility and convenience.
