# Wrap Up

Congratulations, you successfully integrated Airflow with BigQuery!

This guide intentionally covers a limited variation of ETL processes/Operators to focus on the integration itself, 
but this will be a great starting point. 

If you have any suggestions on this guide, leave an issue on the [Github repository](https://github.com/yoonhyejin/airflow-with-bigquery-guide/issues).
